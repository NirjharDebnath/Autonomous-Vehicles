  ## Additional Notes
  
  - Many of these articles discuss both the detection of anomalies (including bad driving and equipment faults) and the reporting/broadcasting of such events, either to the driver, fleet managers, or external systems.
  - The field is rapidly evolving, with a trend toward deep learning, sensor fusion, and integration with vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for real-time anomaly reporting and intervention.

## Assumptions

### Sample space

- We are considering vehicles driving on main roads, expressways and highways and not in neighbourhood roads.
- We consider the idea to be implemented on all vehicles in our sample space.
- We consider the vehicle to be of a standard size (example: private 4 wheelers)

## Abnormality

We propose a set of conditions for detecting abnormality in the vehicle:

### 1. Objective factors:

These factors are to be evaluated directly based on vehicle data.

- Mechanical and electrical issues within the vehicle
- Using phone or engagement in other activity while driving

### 2. Subjective factors:

These factors are to be evaluated by the model based on vehicle data.

- Weaving (S-shaped movement within lane)
- Swerving (Abrupt direction changes)
- Sideslipping (Lateral deviation while moving straight)
- Turning with wide radius (High-speed turn drifting outside lane)
- Inattentive driving (Distracted or drowsy driving)
- Aggressive/reckless driving	(Speeding, tailgating, unsafe lane changes)
- Erratic acceleration (Rapid speed changes after steering)
- DUI (Driving under influence of alcohol or drugs)
- Improper overtaking	(Unsafe passing maneuvers)

## Simple Procedure for Vehicle Abnormality Detection

1. **Collect Data from Vehicle**
   - Use sensors and edge devices (like Arduino or Raspberry Pi) to gather vehicle data.

2. **Create Vehicle Status Table**
   - Store all collected data in a table for easy access and analysis.

3. **Check Objective Data**
   - Analyze direct signals (like engine status, speed, or phone usage).
   - If any abnormality is found here, label as **Abnormal** and send an alert.

4. **If Objective Data is Normal**
   - Continue to analyze subjective data (like driving behavior).

5. **Analyze Subjective Data**
   - Use a basic model (like a machine learning algorithm) to check for unusual driving patterns (weaving, swerving, etc.).

6. **Make Prediction**
   - If the model detects abnormal behavior, label as **Abnormal** and send an alert.
   - If everything is normal, continue monitoring.
