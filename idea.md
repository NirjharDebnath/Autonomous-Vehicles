# Abnormality Detection in Vehicles and Broadcasting

Version: Draft

## Objective

We want to detect potential abnormality in vehicles driving on roads and broadcast them to nearby vehicles as well as local safety enforcement departments such as police or transport department.

## Present research on this topic


## Assumptions

### Sample space

- We are considering vehicles driving on main roads, expressways and highways and not in neighbourhood roads.
- We consider the idea to be implemented on all vehicles in our sample space.
- We consider the vehicle to be of a standard size (example: private 4 wheelers)

## Abnormality

We propose a set of conditions for detecting abnormality in the vehicle:

### 1. Objective factors:

These factors are to be evaluated directly based on vehicle data.

- Mechanical and electrical issues within the vehicle
- Using phone or engagement in other activity while driving

### 2. Subjective factors:

These factors are to be evaluated by the model based on vehicle data.

- Weaving (S-shaped movement within lane)
- Swerving (Abrupt direction changes)
- Sideslipping (Lateral deviation while moving straight)
- Turning with wide radius (High-speed turn drifting outside lane)
- Inattentive driving (Distracted or drowsy driving)
- Aggressive/reckless driving	(Speeding, tailgating, unsafe lane changes)
- Erratic acceleration (Rapid speed changes after steering)
- DUI (Driving under influence of alcohol or drugs)
- Improper overtaking	(Unsafe passing maneuvers)

## Procedure
