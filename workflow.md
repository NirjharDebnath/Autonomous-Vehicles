## **1. Workflow of the System**

### **Core Workflow Steps**

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sensors (LiDAR, cameras, accelerometers) and onboard telemetry collect real-time data:  
     - Vehicle speed, lane position, proximity to objects  
     - Driver behavior (eye tracking, steering patterns)  
     - Environmental data (weather, traffic signs)  

2. **Onboard Processing**  
   - Edge AI processes data locally to detect risks (e.g., drowsiness, overspeeding).  
   - Immediate feedback (voice/text alerts) is sent to the driver.  

3. **Server-Side Federated Learning**  
   - Anonymized, aggregated data from multiple vehicles trains the global AI model.  
   - Improved models are pushed back to vehicles for better risk prediction.  

4. **Emergency Intervention**  
   - If the system predicts an unavoidable collision, it triggers:  
     - Automatic emergency braking  
     - Seatbelt pre-tensioning  
     - Door unlocking  

5. **Continuous Learning**  
   - Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimizes intervention timing based on outcomes.  
   - LLMs refine voice/text suggestions for clarity and driver compliance.
