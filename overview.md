## Overview

Every year, millions of road accidents occur due to human errors such as overspeeding, wrong lane driving, and impaired driving. The need for an intelligent, real-time assistance system that can predict and prevent such avoidable accidents is more pressing than ever.

**Goal:**  
Develop an AI-powered Intelligent Driving Partner for vehicles that monitors, guides, and, in emergencies, intervenes to minimize road accidents, leveraging federated learning, reinforcement learning, and advanced voice/text interaction.

## System Workflow

E --> F[Federated Learning Server]
F --> G[Model Improvement]
G --> B


**Step-by-step workflow:**
1. **Data Collection:**  
   - Sensors (cameras, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) collect vehicle/environment data in real-time.
2. **Onboard Processing:**  
   - Local AI analyzes data for risks (e.g. lane departure, overspeeding, drowsiness).
3. **Driver Feedback:**  
   - Voice or text alerts suggest corrective action.
4. **Emergency Intervention:**  
   - System triggers automatic braking, seatbelt tightening, or door unlock if necessary.
5. **Federated Learning:**  
   - Anonymized incident/behavior data sent to a central server to improve global models.
6. **Model Improvement:**  
   - Improved AI models are sent back to vehicles, closing the learning loop.

## Prototype and Validation Strategy

**Goal:** Prove feasibility using affordable, scalable platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi-based “Pi cars”).

### Steps:

1. **Develop a Pi Car Prototype:**
    - Use Raspberry Pi, camera, ultrasonic sensors, basic motor/servo controls.
    - Integrate OpenCV for lane detection, obstacle avoidance.

2. **Implement Edge AI:**
    - Deploy lightweight ML models (e.g. TensorFlow Lite) for risk detection.

3. **Simulate Key Scenarios:**
    - Lane drift → System alerts and/or auto-corrects.
    - Obstacle detected → Emergency stop engaged.
    - Speed exceeded → Throttle reduction and warning.

4. **Federated Learning Loop:**
    - Use multiple Pi cars to train/install local models.
    - Aggregate anonymized data for central model improvement.

5. **Use Simulators:**
    - Test in virtual environments using [CARLA](https://carla.org) to cover diverse scenarios and rare edge cases.

6. **Performance Metrics:**
    - Track collision rate reduction, intervention accuracy, and false positives.
    - Compare results before/after AI system deployment.
